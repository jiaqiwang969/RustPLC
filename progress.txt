# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- TopologyGraph JSON 调试依赖 `petgraph` 的 `serde-1` feature；若缺失会导致 DiGraph 无法序列化。
- In parser-to-AST lowering, unwrap wrapper PEG rules (e.g., `constraint_declaration`, `step_statement`) before matching concrete rule kinds, or valid nodes can be silently skipped.
- Keep public module declarations centralized in `src/lib.rs`; implementation files live at `src/<module>/mod.rs`.
- For early story scaffolding, keep module placeholders compiling so CLI and library can evolve incrementally without breaking builds.
- Model DSL enums with `serde(rename_all = "snake_case")` and tagged enums so serialized AST tokens stay aligned with DSL keywords.
- In pest grammars, define silent `WHITESPACE` and `COMMENT` rules so inline `#` comments and multiline section formatting parse without extra boilerplate.
- For block-style DSL sections, parse optional `reason: "..."` clauses directly in each declaration rule so indented multiline annotations remain valid without separate line handling.
- In nested `parallel`/`race` grammar, require branch bodies to consume concrete statements so step-level directives are not misparsed as branch labels.
- In semantic topology lowering, treat `connected_to` as upstream linkage (`target -> current`) so causality traversals follow physical flow direction.
- Preserve directive line metadata in AST (e.g., `GotoDirective.line`, `TaskDeclaration.on_complete_line`) so semantic passes can report precise line-numbered errors without reparsing source text.
- For constraint semantic validation, seed known device states from device-type defaults plus `sensor.detects` references before checking `safety` state expressions.

## [2026-02-11 01:19:50 CST] - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Initialized Cargo project `rust_plc` with required dependencies (`pest`, `pest_derive`, `petgraph`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror`).
  - Added `src/lib.rs` module exports and placeholder module files for `parser`, `ast`, `ir`, `semantic`, and `error`.
  - Replaced default CLI with argument validation that accepts exactly one `.plc` file path.
- Files changed
  - `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `src/ast/mod.rs`, `src/ir/mod.rs`, `src/semantic/mod.rs`, `src/error/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Library-facing modules are declared in `src/lib.rs` even when implementation is still a placeholder.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `python` shim is unavailable in this environment; use `python3` for JSON/text automation scripts.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - This story established the baseline crate structure; subsequent parser/AST stories can add logic directly in existing module files.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Replaced the AST placeholder with typed syntax tree models for topology, constraints, and tasks sections.
  - Added device/constraint/task enums and structs covering all required DSL categories (device types, attributes, safety/timing/causality constraints, actions, wait/timeout/goto/on_complete/parallel/race/allow_indefinite_wait/unreachable).
  - Derived `Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize` for all AST-facing data structures to support parser output and downstream serialization.
- Files changed
  - `src/ast/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Keeping AST enums `snake_case` via serde attributes avoids ad-hoc keyword conversion once parser lowering starts.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `cargo clippy` is unavailable in this toolchain unless the clippy component is installed (`rustup component add clippy`).
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `StepStatement` is modeled as a tagged enum, so parser work can map each DSL statement kind directly without extra wrapper types.

## [2026-02-11 01:39:19 CST] - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Added `src/parser/plc.pest` with topology-section PEG rules covering `[topology]`, bare port declarations, attribute blocks, all required device types, and all required topology attribute keys.
  - Added parser entrypoint `parse_topology` in `src/parser/mod.rs` using `pest_derive::Parser` against `parser/plc.pest`.
  - Added parser unit tests for the PRD 5.3 topology sample and an additional topology case that exercises every supported device type plus identifier/string/duration/measured/state-reference value forms.
- Files changed
  - `src/parser/plc.pest`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Defining topology grammar values as a prioritized union (`state_reference` before `identifier`) avoids partial matches when parsing dotted tokens like `cyl_A.extended`.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - Keep keyword-limited `attribute_name` and `device_type` rules explicit in PEG so unsupported topology keys/types fail fast instead of being accepted as generic identifiers.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `parse_topology` currently validates syntax only; AST lowering for topology/constraints/tasks is expected in a later parser story.

## [2026-02-11 01:44:22 CST] - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Extended `src/parser/plc.pest` with `[constraints]` grammar coverage for `safety` (`conflicts_with` + `requires`), `timing` (`must_complete_within` + `must_start_after`), and `causality` chain declarations.
  - Added shared grammar primitives for `timing_scope`, causality arrows, and optional `reason: "..."` clauses so both inline and indented reason annotations parse correctly.
  - Added parser API `parse_constraints` and unit tests for the PRD 5.4 constraints sample plus a focused case covering `requires` and `must_start_after`.
- Files changed
  - `src/parser/plc.pest`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Keeping section-specific parse entrypoints (`parse_topology`, `parse_constraints`) makes it easy to ship grammar stories incrementally while preserving isolated test coverage.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `timing` scopes are intentionally constrained to `task.<name>` or `task.<name>.<step>`; broad identifier chains would over-accept invalid DSL forms.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Constraint parsing is still syntax-only; semantic validation for device/task existence and chain connectivity is deferred to later semantic/verification stories.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Extended `src/parser/plc.pest` with `[tasks]` grammar for task/step declarations, action/wait/timeout/goto statements, `on_complete`, and `allow_indefinite_wait`.
  - Added nested control-flow grammar support for `parallel` and `race` blocks, including branch parsing and `then: goto` handling in race branches.
  - Added `parse_tasks` in `src/parser/mod.rs` plus parser unit tests covering PRD sections 5.5.1 through 5.5.5.
- Files changed
  - `src/parser/plc.pest`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Task grammar entrypoints follow the same section-scoped API pattern as existing parser functions (`parse_topology`/`parse_constraints`), which keeps parser stories independently testable.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - In PEG branch grammars, letting branch bodies be empty can cause tokens like `timeout:` to be accidentally treated as new branch labels; require concrete branch content to avoid this.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Current task parsing remains syntax-only; AST lowering for task statements is still pending the dedicated parser-to-AST story.

## [2026-02-11 08:53:35 CST] - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Added full parser-to-AST builder entrypoint `parse_plc` that parses `[topology]`, `[constraints]`, and `[tasks]` into `PlcProgram` with typed AST nodes.
  - Implemented detailed lowering helpers for devices/attributes, safety-timing-causality constraints, task-step statements, nested `parallel`/`race` branches, and directives (`timeout`, `goto`, `on_complete`, `allow_indefinite_wait`).
  - Added parser error mapping to `PlcError` with line-numbered Chinese diagnostics and added a regression test to assert line reporting on syntax failures.
  - Added end-to-end AST construction tests for PRD 6.3 and PRD 9 complete PLC examples with key field assertions.
- Files changed
  - `.ralph_logs/iter_4.log`, `.ralph_logs/iter_5.log`, `.ralph_logs/iter_6.log`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `src/parser/plc.pest`, `src/error/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Parser lowering is most robust when each grammar wrapper rule is unwrapped immediately, then dispatched by concrete sub-rule for AST conversion.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `Pair::into_inner()` consumes the pair; preserve `pair.as_str()` beforehand when fallback logic needs original token text (e.g., `on_complete: unreachable`).
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Causality chains in current AST are stored as `Vec<StateReference>` using device names with empty `state`; downstream IR/semantic stories should normalize this to explicit device-chain representation.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Replaced `src/ir/mod.rs` placeholder with concrete IR definitions for `TopologyGraph`, `StateMachine`, `ConstraintSet`, and `TimingModel`.
  - Implemented `TopologyGraph` on top of `petgraph::DiGraph<Device, ConnectionType>` with helper APIs for adding devices and connections.
  - Added typed state machine/constraint/timing structures plus `to_pretty_json` helper so IR objects can be serialized with `serde_json::to_string_pretty` for debugging.
  - Added IR unit tests that verify graph node/edge behavior and pretty-JSON serialization/deserialization for all core IR models.
  - Enabled `petgraph`'s `serde-1` feature in Cargo dependencies so graph serialization works.
- Files changed
  - `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `src/ir/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`, `.ralph_logs/iter_6.log`, `.ralph_logs/iter_7.log`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Keep IR enums `snake_case` with serde tags to make debug JSON stable and easy to diff against DSL keywords.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `petgraph::DiGraph` serialization requires the crate feature `serde-1`; adding derives alone is not enough.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `TimingModel` currently stores action timing intervals keyed by deterministic strings (`task.step.action.target`) for straightforward lookup in upcoming semantic stories.

## [2026-02-11 09:16:45 CST] - US-008
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Implemented semantic topology lowering in `src/semantic/mod.rs` via `build_topology_graph`/`build_topology_from_ast`, converting AST devices into `TopologyGraph` nodes and `connected_to` relations into typed directed edges.
  - Added topology semantic validation for undefined `connected_to` references and incompatible device-type connections, both returning Chinese semantic diagnostics with source line numbers.
  - Extended AST device declarations with source line metadata and wired parser lowering to populate it, enabling semantic error reports to point to exact topology lines.
  - Added semantic unit tests covering PRD 5.3 topology graph construction (node/edge counts + edge kinds) and both required failure paths (undefined reference, incompatible connection).
- Files changed
  - `src/semantic/mod.rs`, `src/ast/mod.rs`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `src/error/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Topology semantic checks use AST-carried `DeviceDeclaration.line` values for diagnostics; new semantic passes should keep line metadata on AST nodes they validate.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `connected_to` type compatibility is asymmetric in this model (`target -> current`), so validation must inspect `(target_kind, current_kind)` rather than `(current_kind, target_kind)`.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Current semantic API returns `Result<TopologyGraph, Vec<PlcError>>`, which is ready for future aggregation with StateMachine/ConstraintSet/TimingModel semantic errors.

## [2026-02-11 09:31:45 CST] - US-009
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Implemented semantic state-machine lowering via `build_state_machine` / `build_state_machine_from_ast`, covering task/step states, sequential transitions, goto/on_complete jumps, timeout guards, plus synthetic fork/join and race branch states.
  - Added goto target validation against known task entry states, returning line-numbered semantic errors for unresolved `goto`, `timeout -> goto`, `race then goto`, and `on_complete` targets.
  - Extended AST/parser task metadata with source line tracking (`TaskDeclaration.line`, `TaskDeclaration.on_complete_line`, `StepDeclaration.line`, `GotoDirective.line`) to support accurate semantic diagnostics.
  - Added semantic unit tests for PRD 5.5.1 sequence state-machine construction, PRD 9 race branching behavior, and undefined goto line reporting.
- Files changed
  - `src/semantic/mod.rs`, `src/ast/mod.rs`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Semantic lowering now follows a reusable two-phase approach: build task-entry index first, then resolve all control-flow directives (`goto`/`on_complete`/`then`) against that index.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - If you add semantic checks for control-flow directives, ensure parser captures directive line numbers in AST; otherwise diagnostics regress to coarse task-level line reporting.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - Parallel/race lowering introduces synthetic state names (e.g., `step__parallel_1_fork`, `step__race_1_branch_2`) inside the same task namespace, so downstream verifiers should treat `State.step_name` as an opaque identifier rather than a DSL step token.

## [2026-02-11 09:49:05 CST] - US-010
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Implemented `build_constraint_set` / `build_constraint_set_from_ast` to lower AST constraints into IR `ConstraintSet` (safety, timing, causality) with semantic validation.
  - Added constraint reference checks for undefined devices, undefined states, and undefined timing task/step scopes, returning Chinese line-numbered diagnostics.
  - Implemented `build_timing_model` / `build_timing_model_from_ast` to derive action timing intervals from topology physical attributes (`stroke_time`, `retract_time`, `response_time`, `ramp_time`), including nested parallel/race actions.
  - Extended AST + parser constraint nodes with line metadata (`SafetyConstraint.line`, `TimingConstraint.line`, `CausalityConstraint.line`) so constraint diagnostics can point to exact source lines.
  - Added semantic unit tests covering PRD 5.4 constraint extraction/timing-model values and undefined reference error reporting.
- Files changed
  - `src/semantic/mod.rs`, `src/ast/mod.rs`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`, `.ralph_logs/iter_9.log`, `.ralph_logs/iter_10.log`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Constraint validation is most stable when state legality is inferred from both device-type defaults and topology `detects` declarations.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - If semantic errors must report constraint line numbers, parser must persist line metadata on each constraint AST node (not only on tasks/topology).
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `TimingModel` extraction now recursively traverses `parallel`/`race` branch statements, so action timing coverage is no longer limited to top-level step statements.
