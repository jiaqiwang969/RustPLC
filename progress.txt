# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Keep public module declarations centralized in `src/lib.rs`; implementation files live at `src/<module>/mod.rs`.
- For early story scaffolding, keep module placeholders compiling so CLI and library can evolve incrementally without breaking builds.
- Model DSL enums with `serde(rename_all = "snake_case")` and tagged enums so serialized AST tokens stay aligned with DSL keywords.
- In pest grammars, define silent `WHITESPACE` and `COMMENT` rules so inline `#` comments and multiline section formatting parse without extra boilerplate.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Initialized Cargo project `rust_plc` with required dependencies (`pest`, `pest_derive`, `petgraph`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror`).
  - Added `src/lib.rs` module exports and placeholder module files for `parser`, `ast`, `ir`, `semantic`, and `error`.
  - Replaced default CLI with argument validation that accepts exactly one `.plc` file path.
- Files changed
  - `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `src/ast/mod.rs`, `src/ir/mod.rs`, `src/semantic/mod.rs`, `src/error/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Library-facing modules are declared in `src/lib.rs` even when implementation is still a placeholder.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `python` shim is unavailable in this environment; use `python3` for JSON/text automation scripts.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - This story established the baseline crate structure; subsequent parser/AST stories can add logic directly in existing module files.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Replaced the AST placeholder with typed syntax tree models for topology, constraints, and tasks sections.
  - Added device/constraint/task enums and structs covering all required DSL categories (device types, attributes, safety/timing/causality constraints, actions, wait/timeout/goto/on_complete/parallel/race/allow_indefinite_wait/unreachable).
  - Derived `Debug`, `Clone`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize` for all AST-facing data structures to support parser output and downstream serialization.
- Files changed
  - `src/ast/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Keeping AST enums `snake_case` via serde attributes avoids ad-hoc keyword conversion once parser lowering starts.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `cargo clippy` is unavailable in this toolchain unless the clippy component is installed (`rustup component add clippy`).
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `StepStatement` is modeled as a tagged enum, so parser work can map each DSL statement kind directly without extra wrapper types.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- What was implemented
  - Added `src/parser/plc.pest` with topology-section PEG rules covering `[topology]`, bare port declarations, attribute blocks, all required device types, and all required topology attribute keys.
  - Added parser entrypoint `parse_topology` in `src/parser/mod.rs` using `pest_derive::Parser` against `parser/plc.pest`.
  - Added parser unit tests for the PRD 5.3 topology sample and an additional topology case that exercises every supported device type plus identifier/string/duration/measured/state-reference value forms.
- Files changed
  - `src/parser/plc.pest`, `src/parser/mod.rs`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Defining topology grammar values as a prioritized union (`state_reference` before `identifier`) avoids partial matches when parsing dotted tokens like `cyl_A.extended`.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "do not forget to update Z when changing W")
    - Keep keyword-limited `attribute_name` and `device_type` rules explicit in PEG so unsupported topology keys/types fail fast instead of being accepted as generic identifiers.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `parse_topology` currently validates syntax only; AST lowering for topology/constraints/tasks is expected in a later parser story.
